; Device level parameters
; UseTheseDomainSizes - When enabled (=1), use the sizes defined in the INI
;                        to defined the memory sizes for each domain
;                       When disabled (=0), for STAT_PLC, use the following
;                        defaults:
;                           Max Coils :       32768 elements
;                           Max Input Status: 32768 elements
;                           Max Input Regs:   16384 elements
;                           Max Holding Regs: 16384 elements
;                        All other memory types are 0 elements
;;                        For all other device models, the device communication
;                        interface will attempt to size the memory
;
;                        The default value is 0
;
; UseCounts - When enabled (=1), indicates sizes are in elements
;             When disabled (=0) indicates sizes are in bytes
;
;             Default value is 0
;
; ConservesConn - When enabled (=1), indicates that it is normal for the device
;                 to close the connection (typically based on inactivity).  The
;                 device communication interface will not assume that the
;                 device is down unless it is unable to create a connection and
;                 get a response when it attempts the current scheduled
;                 operation to retrieve data from the device or modify data.
;
;                 When disabled (=0), indicates that a termination of the
;                 connection between the device communication interface and
;                 the device will cause the device communication interface to
;                 assume that the connection is down and terminate the
;                 connection
;
;                 Default value is 0.
;
; ConnSecondary - When Enabled (=1), in a Host Redundant environment,
;                 the device communciation interface will attempt to
;                 maintain a connection with the device on the acting
;                 secondary.
;
;                 When Disabled(=0), in a Host Redundant environment,
;                 the device communication interface will terminate its
;                 connection to the device when transitioning to the
;                 secondary.
;
;                Default value is 1.
;
; OneCoilWrite - When enabled (=1) use Function 5 to write single coils
;                When disabled (=0) use Function 15 to write single coils
;
;                VersaMax ENIU, VersaPoint ENIU and Modicon 484's ignore this
;                parameter.
;
;OneRegiserWrite - When enabled (=1) use Function 6 to write single holding registers
;                  When disabled (=0) use Function 16 to write single holding registers
;
;                  VersaMax ENIU, VersaPoint ENIU and Modicon 484's ignore this
;                  parameter.
